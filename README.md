### Project description
​
The objective of this challenge is to work with someone else's code (Scout Rule), which recommends to always leave the code a little cleaner than how it initially was making sure that all links are functioning correctly, reworking the CSS file to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
